It has developed in parallel with a long program of empirical research, conducted by many researchers, on the situ-ational determinants and the prevention of a wide variety of crimes. For this reason the classification has been subject to constant revision and updating, of which Clarke's (1997) version, which lists 16 such techniques, is the latest.
