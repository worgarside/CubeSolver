abstract = {The paper investigates how urban primacy affects economic growth across countries. Using semi-parametric estimation techniques on a cross-country panel for the years 1960--90, an increasing relationship is unearthed between urban primacy and growth. This result holds even when limiting the sample to the developing country group, thus moderating previous findings on the existence of an optimal level of urban primacy, by suggesting that if such an optimal level exists, the range of values of urban primacy for which it is reached is fairly wide.},

abstract = {The Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division is responsible for providing the international community with up-to-date and scientifically objective information on population and development. The Population Division provides guidance to the United Nations General Assembly, Economic and Social Council, and the Commission on Population and Development on population and development issues and undertakes regular studies on population levels and trends, population estimates and projections, population policies, and population and development inter-relationships. The Population Divisions work encompasses the following substantive areas: the study of mortality, fertility, international and internal migration, including their levels and trends as well as their causes and consequences; estimates and projections of the distribution of the population between urban and rural areas and in cities; estimates and projections of population size, age and sex structure, and demographic indicators for all countries of the world; the documentation and analysis of population and development policies at the national and international levels; and the study of the relationship between socio-economic development and population change. This publication presents the results of the 2003 Revision of the official United Nations estimates and projections of urban and rural populations for major areas, regions and countries of the world and of all urban agglomerations with 750,000 inhabitants or more in 2000. The data in this Revision are consistent with the total populations estimated and projected according to the medium variant of the 2002 Revision of the United Nations global population estimates and projections, published in World Population Prospects: The 2002 Revision1. This Revision updates and supersedes previous estimates and projections published by the United Nations. Data in digital form containing the major results of the 2003 Revision can be purchased from the Population Division. A description of the databases and the order form are given beginning on page 157. This publication and its results may also be accessed on the Population Division world wide web site at www.unpopulation.org.

@article{Heath1997,
abstract = {At the end of the twentieth century our cities face a multitude of problems both of a spatial and functional nature. One of the key issues to be addressed is the limited time—9 a.m. to 5 p.m.—during which we utilize the facilities and opportunities that the city centre has to offer. The Twenty-four Hour City concept is a relatively recent approach of combining a series of wide-ranging initiatives to tackle this problem by revitalizing and creating safer city centres. The main aim of this approach is to attract a wide range of groups back into the city both to use the services and facilities that it has to offer and as residents. This paper will explore the key issues of the Twenty-four Hour City concept and examine the important initiatives that have been adopted in various cities in the UK.},

abstract = {Clarke's classification of situational crime prevention tech-niques is designed to provide a conceptual analysis of situational strategies, and to offer practical guidance on their use in reducing criminal opportunities. It has developed in parallel with a long program of empirical research, conducted by many researchers, on the situ-ational determinants and the prevention of a wide variety of crimes. For this reason the classification has been subject to constant revision and updating, of which Clarke's (1997) version, which lists 16 such techniques, is the latest. Recently, Wortley (2001) has suggested the need to augment the existing classification, which deals with the analysis of situational opportunities, with a complementary analysis of situational precipitators. These are factors within the crime setting it-self that may prompt, provoke, pressure, or permit an individual to of-fend. The present chapter examines the assumptions underlying the development of situational crime prevention, and offers some views about the theoretical and practical significance of Wortley's suggested additions and revisions. It concludes by proposing a revised},
