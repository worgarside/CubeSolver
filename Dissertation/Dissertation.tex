	\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Background}
    \paragraph{}
    In 1974, Ern\"{o} Rubik was struggling to create a cube with independently moving parts which remain together, regardless of how much they moved. His first attempts made use of elastic, which broke and rendered the cube unusable. Rubik persevered in his attempts to hold the blocks (now called \enquote{cubies}) together - eventually concluding that the best way was to have the cubes hold themselves together. He called this design \enquote{The Magic Cube}, and it would go on to be one of the world's best-selling puzzles \cite{Waxman2014b}. It was later re-branded to \enquote{\textit{Rubik's Cube}} to overcome an oversight involving patenting and copyrighting  the design.
    
    \paragraph{}
    In an unpublished manuscript \cite{Rubik1986}, Rubik described first randomising his new cube, \blockquote{It was wonderful to see how, after only a few turns, the colors became mixed, apparently in random fashion. Like after a nice walk when you have seen many lovely sights you decide to go home, after a while I decided it was time to go home, let us put the cubes back in order. And it was at that moment that I came face to face with the Big Challenge: What is the way home?}
    
    \paragraph{}
    It took Rubik over a month to solve this first cube - he knew intuitively that there must be a method to solving the cube, but lacked the finer methodology \cite{RubiksCube}. Since Rubik devised the first method, hobbyists and mathematicians alike have been immersed in solving the Cube as quickly and efficiently as possible. Whilst many solutions are markedly successful when it comes to optimisation, others only better them in quirkiness or internet fame \cite{Chan2016}.
    
    \paragraph{}
    There is one method which is mere speculation, despite having been proved mathematically: God's Algorithm. God's Algorithm states that an omniscient being would always make the most efficient moves and that they would be able to solve a Cube from any given position in a certain number of moves or less. This is referred to as God's Number, and was finally proved to be twenty in 2010 by a group of 4 researchers \cite{Rokicki2010b}.
