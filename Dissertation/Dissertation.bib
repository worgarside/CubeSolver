abstract = {Surgical robotics is an evolving field with great advances having been made over the last decade. The origin of robotics was in the science-fiction literature and from there industrial applications, and more recently commercially available, surgical robotic devices have been realized. In this review, we examine the field of robotics from its roots in literature to its development for clinical surgical use. Surgical mills and telerobotic devices are discussed, as are potential future developments.},

@article{Korf2001,
abstract = {We analyze the time complexity of iterative-deepening-A* (IDA*). We first show how to calculate the exact number of nodes at a given depth of a regular search tree, and the asymptotic brute-force branching factor. We then use this result to analyze IDA* with a consistent, admissible heuristic function. Previous analyses relied on an abstract analytic model, and characterized the heuristic function in terms of its accuracy, but do not apply to concrete problems. In contrast, our analysis allows us to accurately predict the performance of IDA* on actual problems such as the sliding-tile puzzles and Rubik's Cube. The heuristic function is characterized by the distribution of heuristic values over the problem space. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our analysis shows that the asymptotic heuristic branching factor is the same as the brute-force branching factor. Thus, the effect of a heuristic function is to reduce the effective depth of search by a constant, relative to a brute-force search, rather than reducing the effective branching factor. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Johnson2003,
abstract = {Popular interest in robotics has increased astonishingly in the past few years. Robotics is seen by many as offering major new benefits in education at all levels. Before rushing to exploit this popularity, educators should ask serious questions about the universality and longevity of the robotics phenomenon. Is it a fashion? To be useful, the energy released by robotics must be sustained and universal, and the means of exploiting it must be systematic. Universities define their own robotics curriculum, but most schools lack both the resources and freedom to so this, and must work with a national curriculum. If it can be shown that robotics has sustained potential in education, it seems inevitable that new ways need to found to integrate it into the curriculum.},

abstract = {Two pre-college programs have been funded at University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) to promote mathematics, science, engineering and technology (MSET) education among minority middle and high school students by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) respectively. The programs are directed by the first and second author of this paper and are ably supported by graduate students in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at UMES who are also co-authors of the paper. In the NOAA of sponsored middle school program twenty, middle school students participate in a two-week summer activity at UMES. The program endeavors to introduce and generate interest among participants to pursue MSET majors. The NASA-sponsored "Summer Engineering Bridge Program (SEBP)" provides enrichment activities for fifteen to twenty high school seniors in transition to college. The program is five weeks long and is structured to improve the success of marginally accepted engineering majors at UMES during their freshman year in college. While the focus of SEBP is on promoting engineering, other interested MSET majors can also participate and benefit from the program. There are a variety of educational and recreational activities that are integrated in the programs. The focus in this paper is on activities incorporated in the programs using LEGO Mindstorm and LEGO DACTA products for design and embedded computer control of mobile robotic platforms as well as instrumentation and data acquisition using LEGO sensors. Teamwork and cooperative learning are promoted. A similar product suitable for embedded computing activities called MIT Handyboard is also introduced to the high school students.},

@article{Oliphant2006,
abstract = {Python is an interpreted language with ex- pressive syntax that some have compared to executable pseudocode. This might be part of the reason why I fell in love with the language in 1996, when I was seeking a way to prototype algorithms on very large data sets that overwhelmed the capabilities of the other inter- preted computing environments I was familiar with. My enjoyment of programming with Python in- creased as I quickly learned to express complicated ideas in the syntax and objects available with it. The idea that coding in a high-level language can greatly enhance productivity isn't new. Many scientists and engineers are typically exposed to one or more interpreted scientific computing en- vironments early in their careers because they help them write nontrivial computational programs without getting too bogged down in syntax and compilation time lags. Python can be used in ex- actly this way, but its unique features offer an en- vironment that makes it a better choice for scientists and engineers seeking a high-level lan- guage for writing scientific applications. In the rest of this special issue's articles, you'll find a feast of reasons why Python excels as a platform for scien- tific computing. As a small appetizer, consider this list of general features: • A liberal open source license lets you sell, use, or distribute your Python-based application as you see fit—no extra permission necessary. • The fact that Python runs on so many platforms means you don't have to worry about writing an application with limited portability, which also helps avoid vendor lock-in. • The language's clean syntax yet sophisticated con- structs let you write in either a procedural or fully object-oriented fashion, as the situation dictates. • A powerful interactive interpreter allows real- time code development and live experimenta- tion, thus eliminating the time-consuming and productivity-eating compile step from the code- then-test development process. • The ability to extend Python with your own com- piled code means that Python can be taught to do anything as fast as your hardware will allow. • You can embed Python into an existing applica- tion, which means you can instantly add an easy-to-use veneer on top of an older, trusted application. • The ability to interact with a wide variety of other software on your system helps you lever- age the software skills you've already acquired.},

Then, we discuss the basic programming techniques in Python for parallelizing serial scientific applications. It is shown that an efficient implementation of the array-related operations is essential for achieving good parallel performance, as for the serial case. Once the array-related operations are efficiently implemented, probably using a mixed-language implementation, good serial and parallel performance become achievable. This is confirmed by a set of numerical experiments. Python is also shown to be well suited for writing high-level parallel programs.},

abstract = {We have found the first optimal solutions to random instances of Rubik's Cube. The median optimal solution length appears to be 18 moves. The algorithm used is iterative-deepening-A (IDA), with a lowerbound heuristic function based on large memory-based lookup tables, or "pattern databases" (Culberson and Schaeffer 1996). These tables store the exact number of moves required to solve various subgoals of the problem, in this case subsets of the individual movable cubies. We characterize the effectiveness of an admissible heuristic function by its expected value, and hypothesize that the overall performance of the program obeys a relation in which the product of the time and space used equals the size of the state space. Thus, the speed of the program increases linearly with the amount of memory available. As computer memories become larger and cheaper, we believe that this approach will become increasingly cost-effective. Introduction 1 Rubik's Cube, invented in the late 1970s by Ern...},

Asimov's stories reflected the concerns over the danger of technology but they also humanized robots, indicating that it is not technology that is evil but the way it is sometimes abused. His stories were so successful that in 1950 nine of his best short stories were selected for publication as the book I, Robot. In this book you get such greats as: - Catch That Rabbit - Runaround - The Evitable Conflict - Robbie These classics revolutionized science fiction, and just a few years later, in 1957, Asimov s birth country would forever change history by launching the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik.

abstract = {Alice2 is a programming environment designed for teaching programming through building 3D virtual worlds. Based on feedback from user tests, we have created a drag and drop programming system that allows users to experiment with the logic and programming structures taught in introductory programming classes without making syntax errors. While similar programming environments for beginners allow us-ers to experiment with only a few programming concepts, Alice2 allows users to experiment with conditionals, count loops, while loops, variables, parameters, and procedures.},

@misc{Demaine2011,
abstract = {The Rubik's Cube is perhaps the world's most famous and iconic puzzle, well-known to have a rich underlying mathematical struc- ture (group theory). In this paper, we show that the Rubik's Cube also has a rich underlying algorithmic structure. Specifically, we show that the n×n×n Rubik's Cube, as well as the n×n×1 variant, has a “God's Number” (diameter of the configuration space) of $\Theta$(n2/ logn). The up- per bound comes from effectively parallelizing standard $\Theta$(n2) solution algorithms, while the lower bound follows from a counting argument. The upper bound gives an asymptotically optimal algorithm for solving a general Rubik's Cube in the worst case. Given a specific starting state, we show how to find the shortest solution in an n×O(1)×O(1) Rubik's Cube. Finally, we show that finding this optimal solution becomes NP- hard in an n×n×1 Rubik's Cube when the positions and colors of some of the cubies are ignored (not used in determining whether the cube is solved).},
